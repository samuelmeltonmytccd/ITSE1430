1989 software tool and I - launched ISP called "the world"
	still active in midwest
	first ISP to be identified as such

basic principles of internet 
	1) internet is platform independent
	2) no one machine or entity is in charge of internet
	3) 

The web is "only what we want you to see".

web browsers based on hypertext
	which is based on hypercard from Apple

hyperlinks is formal name for hypertext objects

HTML - hyptertext markup language

protocols - series of rules we use to establish communication for devices
TCP/IP - transmission control protocol/internet protocol 
	responsible for establishing communication between 2 or more devices
	establish language they speak
	establish who will talk first, second
	establish timing for interactions

TCP developed in 1978

IP dictates how your messages are broken down and sent out over network

TCP/IP responsible for reliable transmissions from point to point

3 common TCP/IP protocols used in web development environment
	http - between web client and server for non-secure transmissions
	FTP - between 2 or more computers to remotely upload/download files
	

httpS requires a certificate (purchase required)

html5 - 1989 TIM BURNERS LEE published first version of html (1d)
	Created in CERN
	prototype released on "next" computer in 1990
	based on SGML

1992 national center for superconductor applications connected to CERN
	and downloaded 2 copies of that browser
	They developed browser  - Mosaic
		Mark Anderson 
			he released instruction to get images on webpage

paired tag 
	if you open it, you also must close it

markup language is a set of tags/rules

2 different main markup languages
	html
	xml - used for structuring data to converse and pass data to a server

head tag and header tag are two different things

head tag
	head tag always follows the html
	info that viewers won't see
	sets up connections to other content/components
	instructions directly to the browser
	we have to identify a head tag whether we use it or not

favicons 
	icon on tab left of the website

all elements should be lower case except for !DOCTYPE - web standard set by w3c

tags required for an html5 web page
	html, head, title, body, doctype

empty element - not paired, do open and close it on the same instruction
	also called: "one-sided tags"

line break - br -- <br />

nested element
	AKA nested tags
	element that contains another element

paragraph element
	<p> </p>
	block level element
	has special characteristics assigned to it

block level element 
	occupies the entire space of its parent element

Attributes
	All HTML elements can have attributes
	Attributes provide additional information about an element
	Attributes are always specified in the opening tag, never in the closing tag
	Attributes are usually in name/value pairs
	Attribute values are always in double quotes
	attribute name/value pairs are lowercase

4 core attributes: (typically used on every HTML element)
	id - unique identifier for the element
	title - gives a suggested title to the element (tooltip)
	class - allows grouping of elements together to assign choices to a group
	style - define the way the text looks

white space
	active white space - used to separate content from other content (utilize)
	passive white space - white space that's just there because of browser window (minimize)
	browser doesn't care about space in html - indentation or blank lines

comments - descriptive text explaining what is going on
	used to identify a web file - date created, author, description
	used to explain complicated code
	<!-- some text goes here -->




Heading tags - block level elements
	<h1></h1> - largest
	<h2></h2>
	<h3></h3>
	<h4></h4> - about the size of normal text
	<h5></h5>
	<h6></h6>

HTML 5 added new elements designed to help organize content
	accessibility - screen reader friendly
	audio/video support - 
	doctype simplified
	cleaner html code
	handles storage of web page better
	mobile friendly
	current standard

Semantic/Structural elements
	Semantic elements have the name of the tag describing what's inside the tag.
	All are children of body.
<header>	</header>
<article>	</article> 
<aside>		</aside> (right hand side of document)
<footer>	</footer>
<nav>		</nav> (navigation bar setup - right under header)
<section>	</section> (used to divide up large pieces of text)


DIV tag
	<div></div>
	No defined usage rules
	just used to create an organizational element

Grouping elements
	<div></div> - block element too (blank line in front of it and after)

<p>1st paragraph</p>
<p>2nd paragraph</p>
<p>3rd paragraph</p>

Text-level elements
	<br />
	<strong></strong> - bold
	<em></em> - italics

CSS - Cascading style sheets
	css is used to contain information to explain styling for different elements of page
	3 categories of styles
		inline style - in line with the text
		embedded styles - defined in one tag at the top of an html file
		external styles - an external file containing all the styles for added web site.

Inline style example:
<h1 style="color:blue">Text goes here</h1>

<style>
</styles>

external style files
.css

to connect an html file to a css external file

<link href = "filename" rel="stylesheet" />

linked CSS must be ordered how you want them used. base first, overriding specifics after.

inline>embedded>external>browser

don't use inline styles if it can be helped

special characters
	list in appendix A
ASCII
	good for english language

Latin-1 or ISO 8859 - supports 255 characters and most languages that 
	employ latin (English, French, spanish, Italian)

Unicode - 65,536 symbols and any of the world's languages

Copyright symbol - © © © © © © © 
	&#169;

syntax to get any symbol to be visible
&#code;

&copy; - character entity reference for copyright

&nbsp - non breaking space

<p>text here 76054  &nbsp &nbsp </p>

Add an image to a web page:
<img src="filename" alt="text" />
put images that are being used by webpage in one folder
heighth and width will not change actual vallues for your image
width="value"
height="value"
browser will match heighth and width if you only use one. will not keep aspect ratio
