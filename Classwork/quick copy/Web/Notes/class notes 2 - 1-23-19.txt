paired tag 
	if you open it, you also must close it

markup language is a set of tags/rules

2 different main markup languages
	html
	xml - used for structuring data to converse and pass data to a server

head tag and header tag are two different things

head tag
	head tag always follows the html
	info that viewers won't see
	sets up connections to other content/components
	instructions directly to the browser
	we have to identify a head tag whether we use it or not

favicons 
	icon on tab left of the website

all elements should be lower case except for !DOCTYPE - web standard set by w3c

tags required for an html5 web page
	html, head, title, body, doctype

empty element - not paired, do open and close it on the same instruction
	also called: "one-sided tags"

line break - br -- <br />

nested element
	AKA nested tags
	element that contains another element

paragraph element
	<p> </p>
	block level element
	has special characteristics assigned to it

block level element 
	occupies the entire space of its parent element

Attributes
	All HTML elements can have attributes
	Attributes provide additional information about an element
	Attributes are always specified in the opening tag, never in the closing tag
	Attributes are usually in name/value pairs
	Attribute values are always in double quotes
	attribute name/value pairs are lowercase

4 core attributes: (typically used on every HTML element)
	id - unique identifier for the element
	title - gives a suggested title to the element (tooltip)
	class - allows grouping of elements together to assign choices to a group
	style - define the way the text looks

white space
	active white space - used to separate content from other content (utilize)
	passive white space - white space that's just there because of browser window (minimize)
	browser doesn't care about space in html - indentation or blank lines

comments - descriptive text explaining what is going on
	used to identify a web file - date created, author, description
	used to explain complicated code
	<!-- some text goes here -->
