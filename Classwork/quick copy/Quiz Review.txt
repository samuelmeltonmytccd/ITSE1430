20-25 questions, all multiple choice, 

property - 	data in a class that executes methods
		has the look of data
		actually calls methods
		methods that look like fields
		use properties, not fields to expose data publicly

calculated property - 	no backing field for property
			can do anything, provided it returns a value

fields - 	data
methods - 	functionality

CLR - 		common language runtime
		virtualizes out a platform that hides OS details from target layer
			allows a program compiled in C# to run on any platform with a .net runtime
		responsible for security, error management, threading, etc.
		runtime host for .net

Assembly - when app is compiled, it becomes .dll or .exe

Padright example:
	var dept = "toys";
	dept.Padright(10);

Virtual members - You must mark members as virtual if you want to be able to override them later

fields - when to use
	need data stored in a class and it will only be used in a class

Constructors
	class Form
	{
		public Form ()
		{}
		public Form (string title) : this ()
		{}
	}
	The only way to have a constructor call another constructor
	it will always call a default constructor 

Events
	Button btn;
	btn.Click += OnOk;

	OnOk - event handler
	Click - event

	Public event EventHandler Click;

?. - Null conditional operator

be familiar with common controls of controls of windows forms
	which is best to use for what situation
